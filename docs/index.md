## Summary

This Android app would remind people to water their plants on a regular basis. It would take into account whether the plants are inside or outdoors. If the plants are indoor, it will remind with a pre-established frequency. If the plants are outdoors, it would reference the weather service to determine if rainfall received, or expected in the near future, meets the requirements of watering minimums. If precipitation conditions are met, the app would not generate a message for the user.
